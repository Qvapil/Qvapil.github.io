Hello! I'm Ivi, a 1st year PhD candidate at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/),
under the supervision of [Dr. Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html).
My research interests lie broadly in the area of Human-Centered Machine Learning.
Currently, I am investigating how to evaluate and compare large language models based on human alignment.

Before joining MPI-SWS, I received my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), 
where I did my diploma thesis with [Prof. Symeon Papavassiliou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/76).
During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to do a research internship at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html)
under [Dr. Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/), where I worked on high-dimensional active learning.
I also interned at the [National Observatory of Athens](https://www.noa.gr/en/)
and contributed to the development of the [Flash Detection Software](https://kryoneri.astro.noa.gr/en/flash-detection-software/).
