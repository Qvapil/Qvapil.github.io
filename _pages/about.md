Hello! I'm Ivi, a 2nd year PhD candidate at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/),
under the supervision of [Dr. Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html).
My research interests lie broadly in the area of Human-Centered Machine Learning.
Currently, I am researching reliable and efficient methods to evaluate large language models based on human alignment.

Before joining MPI-SWS, I received my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), 
where I did my diploma thesis with Prof. Symeon Papavassiliou.
During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to do research internships at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html)
under Dr. Fanny Yang and at the [National Observatory of Athens](https://www.noa.gr/en/), where I contributed to the development of the [Flash Detection Software](https://kryoneri.astro.noa.gr/en/flash-detection-software/).
